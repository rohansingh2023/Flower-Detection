# Flower-Detection using OpenCV
Flower Detection model to detect flower types namely Rose, Tulip, Daisy, Dandelion, SunFlower.
This model includes concepts from Computer Vision and CNN.



Note:- I've trained the model for only 5 epochs, which is why accuracy is only 54.5%. You can train it for as much epochs as you can, depending on your GPU.
